#Reflections on Git
## By Marissa Berrong 

__What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?__ 

Prior to this session, I was confused about the exact steps to merge information onto the master branch

__What concepts were clarified during the GPS?__

We got clarification on how to start a git directory, and the three stages of the git process

__What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?__

I asked my partner how to remove a directory, and how to do a pull request
I asked the guide about different steps and why they are important

__What still confuses you about Git?__

I'm still confused about fetching and merging. I know it's similar to pushing, but I'm still not quite getting the concept.

__How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?__
I actually had a really good time! I was worried that they were going to go too fast for me, but that wasn't the case at all. I enjoyed asking and also explaining things to another student. Brainstorming with someone is good practice for anyone learning something new.
