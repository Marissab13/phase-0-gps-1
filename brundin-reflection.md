# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*Prior to this GPS session, I was struggling with understanding and following the stages of git, including git add, git status, git commit, and git push

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* We went through the stages various times - I was more clear on git commit messages and git pull and git merge

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

*We asked the guide an easier way to add and remove files, since we were both wary of rm rf. I asked my pair about git pull a lot.

# What still confuses you about Git?

*Merge is still confusing

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

*It was pretty great, Marissa and I worked through alot of issues but she was pleasant to work with!
